5. **Monitor Contacts** - Detected drone contacts appear in the contact list with ID, vectors, risk level, and last seen time
6. **View Map** - Contacts with GPS data from Remote ID are plotted on the live map

### Detection Vectors

- **Remote ID (WiFi/BLE)** — Passive sniff of 802.11 beacon frames and BLE advertisements. Decodes ASTM F3411 payloads: drone GPS, operator ID, drone type, speed, altitude, and emergency status
- **433/868 MHz RF** — RTL-SDR scans ISM bands for drone control link and telemetry RF signatures
- **2.4/5.8 GHz** — HackRF (if present) sweeps video downlink bands for active drone transmissions

### Risk Levels

- **High** — Drone operating without Remote ID (non-compliant) or malformed ASTM frame. Warrants immediate attention.
- **Medium** — Contact detected on multiple RF vectors, or significant RSSI difference between vectors (>15 dB). May indicate evasion or multi-radio platform.
- **Low** — Compliant Remote ID broadcast, single detection vector. Standard consumer drone.

### Tips

- Remote ID is mandatory for drones >250g in the US (FAA) and EU (EU 2019/945) — absence of Remote ID is itself a significant indicator
- WiFi adapter must support monitor mode; run `airmon-ng check kill` if other processes interfere
- The contact map only shows drones that broadcast GPS coordinates via Remote ID
- Contacts expire after 120 seconds of inactivity — the list shows only currently active drones
- HackRF detection is passive (receive-only); no transmission occurs

- For maps, you need a local tile server (e.g., self-hosted OpenStreetMap tiles)
- Missing assets fail gracefully with console warnings
- Useful for air-gapped environments, field deployments, or reducing latency

## Remote Agents (Distributed SIGINT)

Deploy lightweight sensor nodes across multiple locations and aggregate data to a central controller.

### Setting Up an Agent

1. **Install INTERCEPT** on the remote machine
2. **Create config file** (`intercept_agent.cfg`):
   ```ini
   [agent]
   name = sensor-node-1
   port = 8020

   [controller]
   url = http://192.168.1.100:6969
   api_key = your-secret-key
   push_enabled = true

   [modes]
   pager = true
   sensor = true
   adsb = true
   ```
3. **Start the agent**:
   ```bash
   python intercept_agent.py --config intercept_agent.cfg
   ```

### Registering Agents in the Controller

1. Navigate to `/controller/manage` in the main INTERCEPT instance
2. Enter agent details:
   - **Name**: Must match config file (e.g., `sensor-node-1`)
   - **Base URL**: Agent address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:8020`)
   - **API Key**: Must match config file
3. Click "Register Agent"
4. Use "Test" to verify connectivity

### Using Remote Agents

Once registered, agents appear in mode dropdowns:

1. **Select agent** from the dropdown in supported modes
2. **Start mode** - Commands are proxied to the remote agent
3. **View data** - Data streams back to your browser via SSE

### Multi-Agent Streaming

Enable "Show All Agents" to aggregate data from all registered agents simultaneously.

For complete documentation, see [Distributed Agents Guide](DISTRIBUTED_AGENTS.md).

## Webhooks & Notifications

INTERCEPT has a built-in alert engine that fires webhooks when decoded events match configurable rules. This lets you forward pager messages (or events from any other mode) to Discord, Slack, n8n, Home Assistant, or any HTTP endpoint.

### How it works

1. You configure **alert rules** via the Alerts UI — each rule defines which mode and event type to watch, optional match criteria, and a severity level.
2. When an incoming event matches a rule, INTERCEPT stores it in the alert log and POSTs a JSON payload to your configured webhook URL.
3. All modes are supported: pager, sensor, ADS-B, AIS, ACARS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and more.

### Enable the webhook

Set these environment variables in your `.env` file or `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` | _(empty)_ | URL to POST alert payloads to |
| `ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | _(empty)_ | Optional token sent as `X-Alert-Token` header |
| `ALERT_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT` | `5` | HTTP timeout in seconds |

**Local install (`.env`):**
```env
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-endpoint.example.com/intercept-alerts
ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=mysecrettoken
```

**Docker (`.env` or `docker-compose.yml` environment block):**
```env
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-endpoint.example.com/intercept-alerts
ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=mysecrettoken
```

### Create an alert rule

1. Open the **Alerts** panel in INTERCEPT
2. Click **New Rule**
3. Configure:
   - **Mode**: `pager` (or any other mode, or leave blank to match all)
   - **Event type**: `message` for pager decodes (or blank to match all event types)
   - **Match criteria**: leave empty to forward everything, or add filters (e.g. capcode equals `1234567`, or message contains `FIRE`)
   - **Severity**: `low`, `medium`, or `high`
4. Save and enable the rule

### Webhook payload format

INTERCEPT sends a POST request with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "rule_id": 1,
  "mode": "pager",
  "event_type": "message",
  "severity": "medium",
  "title": "My Pager Rule",
  "message": "message | 1234567",
  "created_at": "2026-04-13T10:00:00+00:00",
  "payload": {
    "mode": "pager",
    "event_type": "message",
    "event": {
      "capcode": "1234567",
      "message": "UNIT 4 RESPOND TO 123 MAIN ST",
      "type": "POCSAG1200"
    },
    "rule": { "id": 1, "name": "My Pager Rule" }
  }
}
```

### Sending to Discord

Discord webhooks expect a specific JSON format (`content`, `embeds`), so you need a small relay between INTERCEPT and Discord. Two options:

**Option A — No-code relay (recommended)**

Use [n8n](https://n8n.io), [Make](https://make.com), or [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) to receive INTERCEPT's webhook and forward it to Discord with a custom message template. Point `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` at your workflow's ingest URL.

**Option B — Self-hosted Python relay**

Save this as `discord_relay.py` and run it alongside INTERCEPT:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import urllib.request, json

app = Flask(__name__)

DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_ID/YOUR_TOKEN"

@app.post("/relay")
def relay():
    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    mode = data.get("mode", "unknown").upper()
    title = data.get("title", "Alert")
    message = data.get("message", "")
    event = data.get("payload", {}).get("event", {})

    # Build a readable Discord message
    lines = [f"**[{mode}]** {title}", message]
    if event.get("capcode"):
        lines.append(f"Capcode: `{event['capcode']}`")
    if event.get("type"):
        lines.append(f"Protocol: {event['type']}")

    payload = json.dumps({"content": "\n".join(lines)}).encode()
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL,
        data=payload,
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        method="POST",
    )
    urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=5)
    return "", 204

app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5051)
```

Then set:
```env
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5051/relay
```

Run the relay: `python3 discord_relay.py`

The relay formats pager decodes as Discord messages like:

```
[PAGER] My Pager Rule
message | 1234567
Capcode: `1234567`
Protocol: POCSAG1200
```

### Filtering specific capcodes

To only forward decodes from a specific capcode, set the rule's **Match criteria**:

| Field | Operator | Value |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `capcode` | equals | `1234567` |

Multiple rules can coexist — e.g. one rule for all pager traffic to a general Discord channel, and a second rule for emergency capcodes with `high` severity to a separate channel (using a second relay instance on a different port).

## Configuration

INTERCEPT can be configured via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INTERCEPT_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Server bind address |
| `INTERCEPT_PORT` | `6969` | Server port |
| `INTERCEPT_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug mode |
| `INTERCEPT_LOG_LEVEL` | `WARNING` | Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `INTERCEPT_DEFAULT_GAIN` | `40` | Default RTL-SDR gain |

Example: `INTERCEPT_PORT=8080 sudo ./start.sh`

## Command-line Options

### Production server (recommended)

```
sudo ./start.sh --help

  -p, --port PORT    Port to listen on (default: 6969)
  -H, --host HOST    Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
  -d, --debug        Run in debug mode (Flask dev server)
  --https            Enable HTTPS with self-signed certificate
  --check-deps       Check dependencies and exit
```

> **Note:** `sudo` is required for SDR hardware access, WiFi monitor mode, and Bluetooth low-level operations.

`start.sh` auto-detects gunicorn + gevent and runs a production WSGI server with cooperative greenlets — this handles multiple SSE streams and WebSocket connections concurrently without blocking. Falls back to the Flask dev server if gunicorn is not installed.

### Development server

```
python3 intercept.py --help

  -p, --port PORT    Port to run server on (default: 6969)
  -H, --host HOST    Host to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
  -d, --debug        Enable debug mode
  --check-deps       Check dependencies and exit
```
